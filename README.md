# Image Annotation Tool 

This application streamlines the process of image annotation and masking for AI training purposes. It is particularly beneficial in workflows where existing masks are imperfect and require user modification to enhance accuracy. The tool supports overlaying RGB and binary mask images with adjustable opacity and provides editing capabilities for drawing or erasing features.

The current version is developed in Python and can be executed on both Windows and Linux platforms.
## Installation

The Image Annotation AI Tool is designed for ease of use and convenience. It requires no installation and comes with all necessary dependencies bundled, ensuring seamless operation on any Windows or Linux system.
## Usage

To use the application, run the executable and specify the directories for RGB images and their corresponding Masks. It is important to ensure that each RGB image and its mask share the same filename. Upon specifying the directories, the application will sequentially load each image-mask pair for annotation. The tool allows users to directly overwrite and save changes to the masks as modifications are made.
